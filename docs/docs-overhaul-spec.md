# Akka Documentation Overhaul Specification

## Project Goal
Review and improve Akka's existing SDK documentation at doc.akka.io to:
1. Align with Akka's revised positioning: "Reliable AI for Every Industry. The Agentic Systems Platform."
2. Frame content around the **three barriers** (Production Gap, Liability, Specialist Trap) and **three dimensions** (Reliability, Risk Control, Repeatability)
3. Lead with Spec-Driven Development (SDD) instead of manual/hand-coding approach
4. Organize content by persona: Builders, Operators, Governance & Oversight
5. Add use-case-driven docs alongside existing capability-driven component docs
6. Make content discoverable for both humans and AI agents
7. Reflect governance-first positioning — "built in, not bolted on"

**Why:** Akka has evolved from a developer-install-first product to a full-stack agentic systems platform (developer experience + runtime + governance). The revised positioning sharpens around three barriers customers face and three dimensions Akka solves. Docs must reflect this.

**How to apply:** All content should be framed through the lens of the three dimensions. Lead with SDD, treat manual setup as fallback. Content should address personas explicitly. Governance and compliance should be woven throughout (not siloed into a single section). Competitive differentiation (vs Temporal, LangChain, n8n) should inform "Why Akka" content.

## Positioning Source
Canonical positioning lives in `the corporate llms.txt (external to this repo)` (revised 2026-03).

### Core Message
"Akka is the agentic systems platform built for Reliability, Risk Control, and Repeatability at enterprise scale."

### Three Barriers (the "why")
1. **Production Gap** — AI frameworks built for demos can't deliver durability, resilience, and reliability for production
2. **Liability** — Failures in resilience, governance, and safety carry severe legal, financial, and reputational consequences
3. **Specialist Trap** — Consistent delivery breaks down when agentic AI depends on a handful of experts

### Three Dimensions (the "how")
1. **Reliability** — 99.9999% availability, active-active HA/DR, sub-1 min RTO, zero byte RPO, contractual commitments with indemnities
2. **Risk Control** — Runtime-embedded governance, policy enforcement, self-explanation, self-containment, EU AI Act compliance
3. **Repeatability** — Multi-tenant platform, golden-path workflows, SDD so anyone who can write requirements can build

### Full-Stack Platform Positioning
"The only full stack platform for agentic AI: developer experience, runtime, and governance in one integrated system."

### Key Differentiators
- Bolt-on governance fails (immutable records, human intervention, authorization capture, PII scrubbing arguments)
- Shared compute model cuts infrastructure costs up to 90%
- Sub-10ms memory (vs ~200ms bolt-on)
- 18 years, 100K+ deployments, 2B+ daily users
- 19+ compliance certifications including EU AI Act, ISO 42001, SOC 2

### Competitive Landscape
- **Temporal** — Orchestration only. No agents, memory, governance, or AI capabilities.
- **LangChain** — Developer framework, not a platform. No runtime, HA/DR, or governance.
- **n8n** — Workflow automation tool. No enterprise scale, clustering, or compliance.

### Service Tiers
- **Fast Prod** — Private multi-tenant install in your VPC, production-ready from day one
- **Day 2 Ops** — Adds elastic scaling, live CVE patching, rolling updates, explainability
- **Business Continuity** — Active-active HA/DR across regions/clouds
- **Sovereign Cloud** — Country-isolated, all data stays in-region

### Personas

**Builders** (docs primary audience)
- Application Developers — broadest group, range from senior to no distributed systems background
- AI/ML Engineers — agent design, prompt engineering, model selection, guardrail tuning
- Product Managers / Business Analysts — author specs not code via SDD

**Operators**
- Platform Engineers / PlatformOps — own installation, manage tenants, enforce golden paths
- SREs / DevOps — availability, HA/DR, scaling, incidents

**Governance & Oversight**
- Compliance Analysts — explainability, interaction logging, causal analysis
- InfoSec Engineers — guardrails, policy enforcement, access controls
- FinOps — token tracking, cost optimization

### TCO Arguments (for "Why Akka" content)
- Infrastructure: shared compute, scale-to-zero, consolidated platform
- Operations: managed HA/DR, no-downtime updates, live CVE patching, AAO
- Token/AI: AdaptiveML integration, memory compaction, FinOps tooling, runtime guardrails
- People: specialist trap elimination, wider builder pool, consistent patterns
- Compliance: built-in governance, runtime policy enforcement, inherited certifications

## Scope
- Akka SDK docs (doc.akka.io) — IN SCOPE
- Akka Libraries docs — OUT OF SCOPE (always treated separately)

## Key Principles
1. **AI-first documentation** — The primary consumer is an AI agent as much as a human. Structure, label, and write content so agents can parse, navigate, and act on it. Prefer explicit structure (clear headings, consistent patterns, machine-readable metadata) over prose-heavy narrative. Every page should be useful to an agent retrieving context for a developer.
2. **SDD-first** — Lead with Spec-Driven Development; hand-coding is secondary/fallback
3. Frame around three barriers and three dimensions throughout
4. Materials are educational — teach users how to develop enterprise services
5. Specific SDK details remain available for reference
6. Use-case driven docs alongside capability/component docs
7. Persona-aware: content should speak to Builders, Operators, and Governance audiences
8. Governance woven throughout, not just one section
9. **External links must be machine-identifiable** — All external links use Antora attributes defined in a central registry file (see Platform Implementation Details). A script or agent must be able to find every external link across all doc pages and update it in one pass if the URL changes.

## Writing Standards & Style Guide

Writing standards live in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md), which merges the standards originally defined
here (they take precedence) with practices established while writing the governance and
autonomous-agents pages. Do not maintain style rules in this file; this spec holds only the
migration plan. One rule from the original standards is parked pending team discussion and is not
currently applied: the one-line comment at the top of each tagged snippet region stating what it
demonstrates (existing snippets do not carry these).

## Platform Implementation Details

Source: `https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/tree/main/docs`

### Platform & Tooling
- **Antora** with **AsciiDoc** (`.adoc` files)
- 523 pages across 7 modules: ROOT, getting-started, concepts, sdk, operations, reference, libraries
- Custom Antora UI bundle at `docs/supplemental_ui/`
- Vale linting (Microsoft + write-good styles) — extend with custom rules to enforce writing standards
- Link validation via `asciidoc-link-check`
- Built via Docker, deployed via rsync to `gustav.akka.io` (behind `doc.akka.io`)

### Repository Structure
```

```

### Navigation
Defined in per-module `nav.adoc` files, referenced from `antora.yml` in order. Our restructure involves:
1. Adding new modules or sections for Why Akka, What is Akka, Who Uses Akka, Resources
2. Editing `antora.yml` to reorder the nav file list
3. Editing individual `nav.adoc` files for section-level changes

### External Link Registry
All external URLs defined as Antora attributes in a **single central file**: `docs/src/modules/ROOT/partials/external-links.adoc` (new file). Included by every page via the existing `include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]` chain.

```asciidoc

Usage in pages:
```asciidoc
See the link:{url-blog-agents}[Akka Agents deep-dive, window="new"] for architecture details.
```

To update a URL: change it in one place (`external-links.adoc`), every page picks it up.

### Existing Attributes & Partials
- **Version attributes** generated at build time into `src-managed/modules/ROOT/partials/attributes.adoc`: `{akka-javasdk-version}`, `{akka-cli-version}`, `{java-version}`, etc.
- **Static attributes** in `ROOT/partials/include.adoc`: `{sample-base-url}` (GitHub samples link)
- **Every page starts with** `include::ROOT:partial$include.adoc[]` — this is where the external link registry gets included
- **SDK partials**: `entity-sharding.adoc`, `entity-ids.adoc`, `testing-entity.adoc`, `component-endpoint.adoc` — use these for deduplication

### LLM Output (llms.txt standard — llmstxt.org)

Follows the **llms.txt specification** created by Jeremy Howard (fast.ai/Answer.AI, Sep 2024). Both files are **fully auto-generated** every time the Antora docs are built. No hand-maintained files. The existing `docs/src/modules/ROOT/pages/llms.txt` (currently hand-maintained) is replaced by generated output. The build pipeline (`docs-prod.yml`) handles rsyncing to `doc.akka.io`.

**Standard file names and purposes:**

- **`/llms.txt`** — A curated **index** in Markdown format. Contains a project summary, organized H2 sections of links (`- [Title](url): description`), and an `## Optional` section for supplementary content that can be dropped when context is tight. An agent reads this to understand what docs are available, then selectively fetches only the pages it needs. Small file (1-5 KB).

- **`/llms-full.txt`** — All documentation content **inlined into a single file**. No links to follow — everything is right there. For agents that want to stuff the entire doc set into context at once. Large file (hundreds of KB to MB).

**Note:** The repo currently also generates `llms-ctx.txt` and `llms-ctx-full.txt` (XML-wrapped format from the `llms-txt` Python tool). These are not part of the core llms.txt standard. Decide whether to keep them for backwards compatibility or drop in favor of the standard file names.

**Generation approach:** Extend the existing `llms-txt` Python package usage in the build pipeline, or write a custom Antora extension / post-build script that:
1. Reads the positioning preamble from a template file (practitioner-filtered subset of corporate llms.txt)
2. Walks all built pages, extracts `page-` attributes to build the link index
3. Assembles `llms.txt` per the standard structure (H1 → blockquote → context → H2 sections of links → ## Optional)
4. Assembles `llms-full.txt` by inlining all page content
5. Outputs to the build target alongside the site

### Admonition Types Available
Already supported in the Antora setup:
- `NOTE:` — general information
- `TIP:` — helpful suggestions
- `IMPORTANT:` — critical information
- `CAUTION:` / `WARNING:` — danger/risk
- Custom roles via `[NOTE.manual]` etc. — styled via supplemental UI CSS
- `ifdef::review[...]` and `ifdef::todo[...]` — conditional content visible only in local builds

### Vale Linting Extensions
Add custom Vale rules to enforce writing standards:
- Flag first-person "we" usage
- Flag passive voice
- Flag non-self-descriptive headings (e.g., single-word H2s like "Skeleton", "Basics")
- Flag inline external URLs not using an attribute (enforce link registry usage)

## Agreed Doc Structure (Full Outline)

### Top-Level Nav (reordered)
Why Akka → What is Akka → Tutorials → Developing → Understanding → Operating → Resources → Reference

### Why Akka (NEW — landing entry point)
- The three barriers: Production Gap, Liability, Specialist Trap
- How Akka solves them: Reliability, Risk Control, Repeatability
- Brief competitive context (what's different vs Temporal, LangChain, n8n)
- Should be concise and high-signal — sets the frame, not a deep dive

### What is Akka (NEW — brief platform intro)
- Full-stack platform: developer experience + runtime + governance
- Key capabilities at a glance (SDD, SDK, runtime, governance, AAO)
- Service tiers overview (Fast Prod → Sovereign Cloud)
- Links forward into Tutorials and Developing

### Who Uses Akka (NEW — persona-based navigation, under What is Akka)
A single page listing every persona with curated links to the docs they care about. Serves as a routing page for both humans and agents.

**Builders**
- Application Developers → SDD, Tutorials, SDK components, Use cases, Integrations, Manual setup
- AI/ML Engineers → Agents, Guardrail tuning, Model integrations, Governance config
- Product Managers / Business Analysts → SDD, Spec authoring

**Operators**
- Platform Engineers / PlatformOps → Deployment models, AAO, Tenant management, Golden paths
- SREs / DevOps → HA/DR, Multi-region & resilience, Observability, Scaling, CLI reference

**Governance & Oversight**
- Compliance Analysts → Governance & the runtime, Explainability, Interaction logging, Causal analysis
- InfoSec Engineers → Policy enforcement, Guardrails, Access controls, Security & compliance
- FinOps → Token tracking, Cost optimization, Observability

### Tutorials
- Getting Started: Build first agent (SDD - PRIMARY), Hello World (classic - secondary)
- SDD Tutorials: First agent w/SDD, Multi-agent planner, RAG chat agent, AI with durable memory
- Advanced / Deep Dive: Shopping cart, Knowledge indexing, Additional samples

### Developing
1. Spec-Driven Development (TOP - primary path, see SDD visual requirements below)
2. Components — **reference-style, not educational.** These pages document the SDK programming model component by component (Agents, Workflows, ESE, KVE, Endpoints, Views, Consumers, Timed Actions). No major structural changes planned to existing component pages — they serve their purpose as reference. Improvements limited to: adding Overview (definition, when-to-use, relationships), Testing, and See Also sections where missing; standardizing headings and voice per writing standards.
3. Use Cases (new section - see below)
4. Integrations (new section - see below)
5. Manual Setup (FALLBACK path - not primary)
   - Overview, Prerequisites, CLI install, Repo config, Project creation, Structure,
     Building, Testing, Running locally, Running local cluster

**Note on Developing vs. Tutorials:** Tutorials are educational — guided, end-to-end walkthroughs that teach by building something specific. The Developing section is where you go once you know what you're building — SDD to get started, component reference to look things up, use cases for patterns, integrations for connecting to external systems. The educational "how to think about building with Akka" content lives in Tutorials; Developing is the workbench.

#### SDD Installation Flow
The SDD page must guide users to install in this order:
1. **Primary: AI Marketplace plugin** — Point users to the relevant AI marketplace for their tool (Claude Code, Cursor, etc.) to install the Akka plugin. This is the fastest path.
2. **Fallback: Akka CLI** — Only if the marketplace install doesn't work or isn't available for their tool, fall back to installing the Akka CLI and using `akka specify init`.

This mirrors the SDD-first / manual-fallback principle: marketplace is the golden path, CLI is the fallback. Use a callout box (admonition) for the CLI fallback approach.

#### SDD Section Visual Requirements
The Spec-Driven Development section is the primary entry point for Developing and must be supported with strong visuals:
- **SDD workflow diagram** — Visual showing the end-to-end flow: write spec → Akka generates system → review/customize → deploy. Should make immediately clear what SDD is and how it differs from manual development.
- **Before/after comparison** — Visual or side-by-side showing the same outcome achieved via SDD (spec + generation) vs. manual (code all components by hand). Reinforces why SDD is the primary path.
- **Spec-to-system mapping** — Visual showing how parts of a spec map to generated components (spec requirement → Agent, Workflow, Entity, Endpoint, etc.). Helps users understand what Akka produces from their spec.
- **SDD iteration cycle** — Visual showing the iterative loop: spec → generate → test → refine spec → regenerate. Shows SDD is not a one-shot process.
- Visuals should be created as SVG or similar format that renders well for both humans and can have alt-text/descriptions for agent consumption.

### Use Cases (new section under Developing)
Each use case page includes: pattern description, which Akka components are involved, and a walkthrough of a real sample project showing how the system is composed. Code is pulled from `samples/` via `include::example$...` — no fabricated snippets. Use cases without a backing sample ship as stubs (pattern + component list, no code walkthrough) until a real example exists.

| Use Case | Status | Backing Sample(s) |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Conversational AI | Ready | `helloworld-agent`, `customer-service-chat`, `travel-planning-agent` |
| Autonomous Agents | Ready | `release-note-summarizer`, `medical-discharge-tagging`, `iot-sensor-monitoring` |
| Multi-Agent Systems | Ready | `multi-agent`, `customer-service-chat` |
| Memory & State | Ready | `travel-planning-agent`, `shopping-cart-quickstart`, `key-value-customer-registry`, `event-sourced-customer-registry` |
| RAG & Knowledge | Ready | `ask-akka-agent` |
| Streaming AI | Ready | `iot-sensor-monitoring`, `event-sourced-customer-registry-subscriber` |
| Orchestration & Durability | Ready | `transfer-workflow`, `transfer-workflow-orchestration`, `transfer-workflow-compensation`, `choreography-saga-quickstart`, `reliable-timers` |
| APIs & Exposure | Ready | `endpoint-jwt`, `trip-booking-with-tools` |
| Governance & Compliance | Partial | `medical-discharge-tagging` (human verification), `transfer-workflow-compensation` (compensation), `tracing` (observability). Pattern guide can be written; may need a dedicated governance-focused sample for full walkthrough. |
| Enterprise Patterns | Ready | `shopping-cart-quickstart`, `choreography-saga-quickstart`, `spring-dependency-injection` |

### Integrations (new section under Developing)
Organized by role, not technology. Key framing: Akka runs on the JVM — all integrations use **industry-standard Java APIs and client libraries**. No proprietary adapters or Akka-specific wrappers needed. If a Java client exists for it, you can use it in Akka.

- **AI & Models:**
  - LLM providers (built-in — 9 providers supported natively): Anthropic, OpenAI, Google AI Gemini, Google Cloud Vertex AI, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, LocalAI, Hugging Face, plus custom providers via `ModelProvider.Custom` interface. **Link to existing docs** — already well-documented at [Agents](https://doc.akka.io/java/agents.html) and [Model Provider Details](https://doc.akka.io/java/model-provider-details.html). Do not duplicate.
  - Embedding models — gap in current docs, needs new content
  - Model selection guidance — gap in current docs (which model for which use case)
- **Data & Knowledge:**
  - Vector databases: Pinecone, Weaviate, Qdrant, Chroma, pgvector — via their Java client libraries
  - Relational databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL — via JDBC
  - NoSQL databases: MongoDB, DynamoDB, Cassandra — via their Java client libraries
  - Search engines: Elasticsearch, OpenSearch — via their Java client libraries
  - **No caching layer needed.** Akka's entity components (Event Sourced Entities, Key Value Entities) are in-memory systems of durable record — all data is durable, immutable, and in-memory with sub-10ms access. There is no need for a separate cache like Redis. This should be called out explicitly as a differentiator and a common question answered.
- **Messaging & Events:**
  - **Akka-native first.** Akka has built-in messaging capabilities (brokerless pub/sub, service-to-service eventing, event-driven consumers) that should be the primary path. These are durable, integrated with the runtime, and require no external infrastructure.
  - External message brokers (when needed for integration with systems outside Akka): Kafka, Google Pub/Sub, Azure Event Hubs — via their Java client libraries
  - Webhooks for external system callbacks
- **APIs & Protocols:**
  - REST/HTTP endpoints (built-in)
  - OpenAPI schema generation (built-in — see [HTTP Endpoints: OpenAPI](https://doc.akka.io/sdk/http-endpoints.html#_openapi_endpoint_schema))
  - WebSockets (built-in — see [HTTP Endpoints: WebSocket](https://doc.akka.io/sdk/http-endpoints.html#websocket))
  - gRPC (built-in)
  - Agent protocol support — **A2A, ACP, and MCP clients are baked into Akka's Agent component**. Agents natively consume tools and communicate with other agents via all three protocols. No external libraries needed.
  - MCP server (built-in — MCP Endpoints component exposes Agent functions to remote LLMs via `@FunctionTool` annotations)
  - MCP CLI server (built-in — `akka mcp serve` exposes CLI operations as MCP tools for Claude Desktop, VS Code, Cursor)
  - See also: [MCP, A2A, ACP: What Does It All Mean?](https://akka.io/blog/mcp-a2a-acp-what-does-it-all-mean)
- **Identity & Security:**
  - Akka-native secret management (built-in — project-level secrets injected as env vars, supports generic secrets, symmetric/asymmetric keys, TLS certs/CA bundles, key rotation without env var changes, values never exposed in CLI/Console). See [Manage secrets](https://doc.akka.io/operations/projects/secrets.html)
  - External secrets: Azure KeyVault integration (currently documented). See [Manage external secrets](https://doc.akka.io/operations/projects/external-secrets.html)
  - Other external providers (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault) — via standard Java APIs
- **Observability:**
  - OpenTelemetry metrics and logs exporting (built-in) — feed into any OTEL-compatible backend (Grafana, Datadog, New Relic, etc.)
- ~~Notifications~~ — Removed. Sending notifications (email, SMS, Slack) is just a standard Java API call to the relevant service. No Akka-specific integration pattern needed; covered by the general "standard Java APIs" framing.

### llms.txt Specification (for doc.akka.io)

**Fully auto-generated** at every Antora build. Follows the llms.txt standard (llmstxt.org). The generator assembles from two sources:

1. **Positioning preamble template** — A static template file in the repo containing the practitioner-filtered subset of the corporate llms.txt. Updated manually only when corporate positioning changes.
2. **Page metadata** — Extracted automatically from `:page-*:` attributes on every built page.

**Positioning preamble includes (filtered for practitioners):**
- Core positioning: three barriers, three dimensions — so agents frame answers correctly
- Platform overview: what Akka is, full-stack positioning — so agents understand the whole, not just SDK parts
- Key differentiators: governance built-in, sub-10ms memory, shared compute, 99.9999% availability — so agents can explain "why Akka"
- Personas (Builders, Operators, Governance & Oversight) — so agents tailor responses by role
- Competitive landscape (brief): Temporal, LangChain, n8n — agents get asked "how is this different?"
- Customer stories (brief, by vertical) — social proof when agents recommend patterns

**Positioning preamble excludes (stays only in corporate llms.txt):**
- Buying personas (CAIO, CFO, procurement, legal)
- TCO breakdown details (sales context)
- Service tier pricing specifics
- Partner list
- Professional services details

**Auto-generated sections (from page metadata):**
- SDK component links — pages with `:page-component-type:` grouped and described
- Getting started links by persona — pages tagged with `:page-persona:` grouped by role
- Use case links — use case pages listed with summaries
- Integration links — integration pages listed with summaries
- Full doc site map — every page's URL + `:page-summary:`

**Generated `llms.txt` structure (per llmstxt.org standard):**
```markdown

## Implementation Requirements

### Review Process
- Multiple reviewers via GitHub pull request process
- This is why staged commits matter — reviewers need to be able to evaluate individual changes without wading through a monolithic diff

### Staged Commits
All changes MUST be staged as individually reviewable commits within a single PR:

1. **One logical change per commit** — Each commit should represent a single, reviewable unit of work (e.g., "add Why Akka page", "restructure nav order", "add external links to Agents component page"). A reviewer should be able to understand and evaluate each commit independently.

2. **Commit ordering** — Commits should be ordered so the docs build and render correctly at each step:
   - Structural changes first (nav reordering, new empty pages/sections)
   - Content changes next (new page content, rewrites of existing pages)
   - Cross-linking last (adding external content links, persona routing links)

3. **Commit message format** — Each commit message should state what changed and why, referencing the spec section it implements (e.g., "Add Why Akka landing page — three barriers/dimensions framing per spec").

4. **No compound commits** — Do not bundle unrelated changes. A commit that adds a new page should not also restructure an unrelated section. If a reviewer says "I approve half of this" the commit is too big.

5. **Suggested commit sequence** (approximate, adapt as needed):
   - Nav restructure (add Why Akka, What is Akka, Who Uses Akka placeholders)
   - Why Akka page content
   - What is Akka page content
   - Who Uses Akka persona routing page
   - Tutorials section reorder (SDD-first)
   - Developing section reorder (SDD top, manual setup fallback)
   - New Use Cases section (one commit per use case page, or group related stubs)
   - New Integrations section
   - Understanding section updates (new Governance & the Runtime page, Architecture reframe)
   - Operating section updates (service tier alignment, persona-aware observability)
   - Reference section updates (glossary, llms.txt)
   - External content links — one commit per doc section (e.g., "Add external links to Understanding pages")
   - Foundational resources page (Reactive Manifesto, Reactive Principles, books)

## Existing Page Audit

Full audit of all pages in `https://github.com/akka/akka-sdk/tree/main/docs`. Source has 523 pages across 7 modules.

### Summary

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Keep as-is | ~185 | Mostly auto-generated CLI reference + views query syntax reference. Add metadata only. |
| Light touch-up | ~75 | Add page metadata attributes, Overview/See Also sections, voice fixes to second-person. |
| Rewrite | ~20 | SDD-first alignment, page structure template, major repositioning. |
| New | ~8 | Why Akka, What is Akka, Who Uses Akka, Resources, Governance & the Runtime, etc. |
| Merge | 1 | `concepts/concepts.adoc` into `concepts/index.adoc` |
| Delete | 0 | No pages identified for deletion. |

### High-Priority Rewrites (do first)
1. `sdk:spec-driven-development.adoc` — THE canonical SDD page. Must be the most polished page on the site.
2. `concepts:ai-agents.adoc` — Foundational AI positioning. Rewrite around three barriers.
3. `sdk:agents.adoc` — Primary component page, most-visited. SDD-first, page template.
4. `getting-started:author-your-first-service.adoc` — First-touch experience. Must lead with SDD.
5. `concepts:development-process.adoc` — Must flip to SDD-first.
6. `concepts:architecture-model.adoc` — Reframe as full-stack platform positioning.
7. `sdk:agents/guardrails.adoc` — Risk Control showcase. Governance-built-in.
8. `sdk:sanitization.adoc` — PII scrubbing as built-in governance, EU AI Act.
9. `operations:akka-platform.adoc` — AAO value prop, service tiers.
10. `reference:glossary.adoc` — Expand with AI terms, three-barriers/dimensions terminology.

### Module-Level Notes

- `starthere.adoc` and `index.adoc`: Rewrite as Tutorials landing page with persona-based recommendations
- `author-your-first-service.adoc`: Rewrite to lead with SDD (currently hand-codes first)
- `spec-your-first-agent.adoc`: Already SDD-first, light touch-up
- Planner agent sub-pages (7): Light touch-up (metadata, voice, See Also)
- Ask-akka-agent sub-pages (5): Light touch-up
- Shopping cart (3): Rewrite to lead with SDD
- `samples.adoc`: Keep as-is, add metadata

- `sanitization.adoc`: Rewrite — governance-built-in showcase
- Agent sub-pages (11): Light touch-up
- Integrations sub-pages (5): Light touch-up

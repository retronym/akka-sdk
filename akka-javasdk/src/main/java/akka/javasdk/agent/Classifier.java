/**
 * A classifier maps an input to a {@link Classification} — a score and/or label, with optional
 * confidence and metadata. Can be implemented with rules or regex, embeddings, traditional ML, a
 * small specialised model, a prompted or fine-tuned LLM, or an external classification API — the
 * implementation is just user code calling out to whatever it needs.
 *
 * <p>An implementation has a public constructor, optionally taking a {@link ClassifierContext}
 * parameter, which gives access to the classifier's configured name, its config section, and a
 * {@link ClassifierClient} for composing other configured classifiers (for example, an ensemble
 * classifier combining several underlying classifiers).
 *
 * <p>Unlike a {@link Guardrail}, a classifier is never bound to a call boundary and is never
 * dispatched by the runtime. It is invoked inline, wherever a guardrail, an evaluator, or
 * application code needs it, by looking it up from an injected {@link ClassifierClient}.
 *
 * <p>Classifiers are enabled with configuration; see agent documentation.

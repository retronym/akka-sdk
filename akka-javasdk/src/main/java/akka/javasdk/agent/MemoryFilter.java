/**
 * Filters for controlling which messages are included when retrieving session history from memory.
 *
 * <p>Memory filters allow you to selectively include or exclude messages based on the agent
 * component id or role that produced them. This is useful in multi-agent scenarios where you want
 * to:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Retrieve only messages from specific agents (e.g., only from a "summarizer" agent)
 *   <li>Exclude messages from certain agents (e.g., exclude internal agents from user-facing
 *       history)
 *   <li>Filter by agent role to group related functionality
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Filters can be combined with other query parameters like {@code lastN} to retrieve the most
 * recent N messages that match the filter criteria.
 *
 * <p>The static factory methods return a {@link MemoryFilterSupplier} which provides a fluent
 * builder API for composing multiple filters. This supplier is designed to be used directly with
 * {@link MemoryProvider} methods.
 *
 * <p>These filters are used with {@code MemoryProvider} implementations (such as {@link
 * MemoryProvider.LimitedWindowMemoryProvider}) or directly with {@link SessionMemoryEntity}.
 *
 * @see MemoryProvider.LimitedWindowMemoryProvider for usage examples
